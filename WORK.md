# Work Progress Summary

## Current Status: COMPLETED ✅

The fontgrepc project has been successfully upgraded with git-tag-based semversioning, comprehensive testing, and automated CI/CD workflows.

## Completed Work

### 1. Git-Tag-Based Semversioning System ✅
- **Created `build.rs`** for extracting version information from git tags
- **Implemented fallback mechanism** for non-git environments
- **Added version validation** and error handling
- **Created development scripts** for version management:
  - `scripts/version.sh` - Check current version and suggest next versions
  - `scripts/tag.sh` - Create properly formatted git tags with version sync
  - `scripts/build.sh` - Build with version extraction
  - `scripts/release.sh` - Complete release workflow
  - `scripts/test.sh` - Comprehensive test runner

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅
- **Added 25+ unit tests** for the cache module covering:
  - Cache creation and initialization
  - Font batch operations
  - Search functionality (by features, scripts, tables, etc.)
  - Statistics generation
  - Cleanup operations
  - Concurrent access safety
  - Error handling
- **Created integration tests** for CLI functionality
- **Added performance benchmarks** using criterion
- **All tests passing** with proper temporary file handling

### 3. Build and Release Scripts ✅
- **Local development scripts** for streamlined workflow
- **Cross-platform build support** with proper optimization
- **Automated release process** with validation and safety checks
- **Version consistency** between git tags and Cargo.toml

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflows ✅
- **CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`):
  - Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
  - Multiple Rust versions (stable, beta, nightly)
  - Code formatting and linting
  - Security auditing
  - Cross-compilation testing
  - Benchmark regression testing
  - Documentation building

- **Release Pipeline** (`release.yml`):
  - Automated releases on git tags
  - Multi-platform binary generation
  - Checksum generation for security
  - Automatic changelog generation
  - Crates.io publishing
  - Homebrew formula generation

- **Nightly Pipeline** (`nightly.yml`):
  - Extended testing with multiple configurations
  - Dependency update checking
  - Performance regression detection
  - Documentation validation
  - Memory leak detection

- **Pull Request Pipeline** (`pr.yml`):
  - Fast feedback on pull requests
  - Code quality checks
  - Version consistency validation

### 5. Multi-Platform Binary Releases ✅
- **Target platforms**:
  - Linux (x86_64 gnu/musl, aarch64)
  - macOS (x86_64, ARM64)
  - Windows (x86_64)
- **Binary optimization** with LTO, stripping, and compression
- **Automated artifact generation** with checksums
- **Multiple installation methods** documented

### 6. Documentation and Maintenance ✅
- **Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md** with release history
- **Updated project documentation** with new workflows
- **Added development guidelines** and contribution instructions
- **Documented all scripts** with usage examples

## Key Achievements

1. **Fully Automated Release Process**: From git tag to published binaries and crates.io
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: 25+ unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks
3. **Multi-Platform Support**: Native binaries for all major platforms
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-use scripts for common development tasks
5. **Production-Ready**: Proper error handling, security scanning, and quality checks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Version Management
- Git tags serve as the single source of truth for versions
- `build.rs` extracts version at compile time
- Scripts ensure consistency between git tags and Cargo.toml
- Semantic versioning strictly enforced

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit tests**: 25+ tests covering all major cache functionality
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end CLI testing
- **Property-based testing**: Ready for implementation with proptest
- **Benchmarks**: Performance monitoring and regression detection
- **Cross-platform testing**: Ensures compatibility across OS

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Fast feedback**: PR checks complete in minutes
- **Comprehensive validation**: Multiple test levels and quality checks
- **Automated releases**: Zero-touch deployment on git tags
- **Security focus**: Dependency scanning and audit trails
- **Performance monitoring**: Benchmark tracking and regression alerts

### Quality Assurance
- **Code formatting**: Enforced with rustfmt
- **Linting**: Comprehensive clippy checks
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Documentation**: Build verification and link checking
- **Performance**: Regression testing and optimization

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

1. **Additional Testing**: Add tests for font.rs, matchers.rs, and query.rs modules
2. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
3. **Feature Expansion**: Add new font search capabilities
4. **Community**: Set up issue templates and contribution guidelines
5. **Monitoring**: Add telemetry and usage analytics

## Scripts Usage

### For Development
```bash
# Check current version status
./scripts/version.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Build optimized binary
./scripts/build.sh
```

### For Releases
```bash
# Create a new release
./scripts/release.sh v1.0.6

# Or interactive mode
./scripts/release.sh
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./scripts/test.sh --coverage

# Run specific test types
./scripts/test.sh --integration
./scripts/test.sh --bench
```
